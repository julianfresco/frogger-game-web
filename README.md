### How to play
------

##### Objective

To score 10 points, you must traverse the path full of bug enemies (avoid touching them at all costs--gross!!) to get to the other side. After scoring, your player will be reset to their initial position for another attempt. A collision with an enemy will cost you some points. Be on guard, over time your enemies will get faster.
